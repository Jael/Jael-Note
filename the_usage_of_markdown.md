To include code (formatted in monospace font), you can either surround inline code with backticks (`), like in

Some text with `some code` inside,

or indent several lines of code by at least four spaces, as in:

    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code
> "This entire paragraph of text will be enclosed in an HTML blockquote element.
Blockquote elements are reflowable. You may arbitrarily
wrap the text to your liking, and it will all be parsed
into a single blockquote element."

The above would translate into the following HTML:

<blockquote><p>This entire paragraph of text will be enclosed in an HTML blockquote element. Blockquote 
elements are reflowable. You may arbitrarily wrap the text to your liking, and it will all
be parsed into a single blockquote element.</p></blockquote>
